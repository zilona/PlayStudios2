# Online Video TaskÂ 
Hometask from PlayStudios.
The full task is written in the pdf in the "ReadMe" folder.

In general, I had to look at the video's data and classify each video into 3 categories and find the main characteristics.

**In this repository there are 3 folders:**
- ReadMe : the task I got.
- Data : the data I used
- MyClassification: the final version of my work
